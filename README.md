# MidiaCatalog
*Catalog using IMDB APIs.
This project is a Java challange that we can find here https://7daysofcode.io/;
The point is not use external libraries here, using just JRE.*

**First day**:
On the first day, you will make your Java code consume an IMDB API, fetch the top 250 movies from their list and print the corresponding 
JSON in the console.

**Second day**:
On that day, you will parse the JSON response obtained from IMDB to extract its information and attributes (like title, poster, note, etc).

**Third day**:
Here, you will start to model your code in a better way, thinking a little about Object Orientation. 
You will create a 'Movie' structure with some attributes, with the intention that each object of this type encapsulates its own data.

**Fourth day**:
It's time to play with HTML! In today's challenge, you will work with the output and generate an HTML page from the list of objects you obtained earlier. 
The idea will be to create an HTML page where you can see the information about the movie, including the poster and the note.

**Fifth day**:
At this point, you will have made a lot of strides in code modeling, but you will likely still have exposed code.
Your task will be to encapsulate some of the calls developed so far in new classes.

**Sixth day**:
Here you will see an important and very high level point. Your challenge will be to make your code more generic, 
that is, prepared to receive data from other APIs. For this you will use interfaces.

**Seventh day**:
On the seventh and final day of the challenge, you will be able to sort your list based on different attributes, using the Collections class and the Comparable and Comparator interfaces.
You will close with a golden key!
